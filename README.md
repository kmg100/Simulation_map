## Simulation_map
This project works on simulating the antenna path loss depending on 4 conditions:

+ Static simulation.
+ Linear movement.
+ Eliptic movement.
+ Teleprtation movement.

## Structure
-----------------------
main.py is a libary for simulating the path loss value, when distance in meters, frequency in Ghz are given.

CoM.py is code for calculating the centre of mass of a contour
